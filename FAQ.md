# runcode - Frequently asked questions and known issues
 
- Make sure that the executables you need are in your path (e.g., R, Julia, Python)
- Backward compatibility: runcode involves many components, including the LaTeX compiler, R, Julia, Python, etc. We try to make it as backward compatible as possible, but this is not always possible since it depends on backward compatibility of individual components. We recommend using the latest stable version of each component.
- Package conflicts: runcode uses a small number of contributed LaTeX packages (see the documentation). These packages work well together, and we are not aware of any conflicts. However, users are very likely to use other packages and it may happen that these packages have definitions which conflict with one of the packages that runcode relies on. We are currently not aware of any specific example, but in general we find that when such conflict between packages arises, stackexchange is an excellent place to find a solution or a workaround.
- Port conflict (server-mode): if you are using runcode in its server-mode, keep in mind that the IP port is per-project. If you are working on multiple projects at the same time, just use a different port number for each one. If you see a warning that the server is already running, check that your config file points to the project-specific port. If the wrong port is used you may get errors when trying to access undefined variables or functions, or worse – you may get no error because the variables/functions are defined but are not what you assume them to be.
 Forking on Windows: the talk2stat package has an option to run the server in the background by forking a child process. This works transparently on Linux and Mac, but on Windows you may get an error:
  AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'fork'
To fix it, you can install Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/) or WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
Another possibility is to disable the forking option by changing the runcode.sty file, and add the “doFork=FALSE” option to the invocation of talk2stat’s server initiation.
Note – in the near future we will detect the system’s support for forking and change the invocation of the server automatically.
- Interactive commands: note that runcode connects to a statistical tool and emulates an interactive session, which means that it expects the prompt from the program in order to detect the completion of an operation. Therefore, commands which do not return a prompt must be avoided. For example, in R we may want to get help on a function (say, ls) by using “?ls”. R shows one screen at a time and the user must scroll down to get the prompt. Such command will cause runcode to hang. There is a built-in timeout to prevent an infinite wait, but such commands must be avoided.
- Log files: runcode keeps a log file in the project directory (one for each statistical language used by the author). If an error occurs or the output seen in the pdf file seems incorrect, these log files should contain useful clues. Furthermore, the project’s log file, generated by pdflatex, will also contain useful hints. For example, if a connection to the server is refused, or if R/Julia/Matlab reported some syntax error, it will be sent to stderr, and pdflatex will include them in the log file. Finally, runcode keeps intermediate files (code and output) in the project’s tmp directory. These files are not deleted automatically by runcode since they may be used for cache, but are also useful for debugging when necessary).
