# runcode

`runcode` is a LaTeX package that executes programming source codes (including
all command line tools) from LaTeX, and embeds the results in the resulting pdf
file. Many programming languages can be easily used and any command-line
executable can be invoked when preparing the pdf file from a tex file. `runcode`
is also available on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/runcode).

It is recommended to use this package in the server mode together with the
[Python](https://www.python.org/)
[talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/) package. Currently, the server
mode supports [Julia](https://julialang.org/),
[MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html),
[Python](https://www.python.org/), and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). More
languages will be added.

## Installation

You can simply put the runcode.sty file in the LaTeX project folder.

The server mode requires the [talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/)
package. To install it from the command line, use:

```
pip3 install talk2stat
```

**Note**: `runcode` requires to enable the `shell-escape` option when compiling
a LaTeX document.
 <!-- From the command line, it is done like this: -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- latex --shell-escape myFile.tex -->

<!-- ``` -->

## Usage

### Load the package:

```latex
\usepackage[options]{runcode}
```

Available options are: 

- `cache`: use cached results.

- `julia`: start server for [Julia](https://julialang.org/) (requires
  [talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/)).

- `matlab`: start server for
  [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (requires
  [talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/)).

- `nominted`: use the [fvextra](https://ctan.org/pkg/fvextra) package instead of
  the [minted](https://ctan.org/pkg/minted) package to show code (this does not
  require the [pygments](https://pygments.org/) package, but it does not provide
  syntax highlights).

- `nohup`: use the `nohup` command when starting a server. When using the
  server-mode, some editors terminate all child processes after LaTeX compiling
  such as Emacs with Auctex. This option set the variable notnohup to be false,
  and the server will not be terminated by the parent process. **This option
  has to be declared before declaring any language**, e.g., `[nohup, R]` works
  but `[R, nohup]` does not work.

- `python`: start server for [Python](https://www.python.org/) (requires
  [talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/)).

- `run`: run source code.

- `R`: start server for [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (requires
  [talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/)).

- `stopserver`: stop the server(s) when the pdf compilation is done.

**Note**: If [minted](https://ctan.org/pkg/minted) is used, the style of the code block is controlled through the minted package,  [e.g.:](https://github.com/Ossifragus/runcode/blob/master/examples/MontyHall/MontyHall.tex#L3-L4)
```latex
\setminted[julia]{linenos, frame=single, bgcolor=bg, breaklines=true}
\setminted[R]{linenos, frame=single, bgcolor=lightgray, breaklines=true}
```
The outputs from executing codes are displayed in [tcolorbox](https://ctan.org/pkg/tcolorbox?lang=en), so the style can be customized with `\tcbset`, [e.g.:](https://github.com/Ossifragus/runcode/blob/master/examples/MontyHall/MontyHall.tex#L5)
```latex
\tcbset{breakable,colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black}
```

### Basic commands:

- `\runExtCode{Arg1}{Arg2}{Arg3}[Arg4]` runs an external code.
  
  - `Arg1` is the executable program.
  - `Arg2` is the source file name.
  - `Arg3` is the output file name (with an empty value, the counter
    `codeOutput` is used).
  - `Arg4` controls whether to run the code. `Arg4` is optional with three
    possible values: if skipped or with empty value, the value of the global
    Boolean variable `runcode` is used; if the value is set to `run`, the code
    will be executed; if set to `cache` (or anything else), use cached results
    (see more about the cache below).

- `\showCode{Arg1}{Arg2}[Arg3][Arg4]` shows the source code, using
  [minted](https://ctan.org/pkg/minted) for a pretty layout or
  [fvextra](https://ctan.org/pkg/fvextra) (if [pygments](https://pygments.org/)
  is not installed).
  
  - `Arg1` is the programming language.
  - `Arg2` is the source file name.
  - `Arg3` is the first line to show (optional with a default value 1).
  - `Arg4` is the last line to show (optional with a default value of the last
    line).

- `\includeOutput{Arg1}[Arg2]` is used to embed the output from executed code.
  
  - `Arg1` is the output file name, and it needs to have the same value as that
    of `Arg3` in `\runExtCode`. If an empty value is given to `Arg1`, the
    counter `codeOutput` is used.
  - `Arg2` is optional and it controls the type of output with a default value
    `vbox`
    - `vbox` (or skipped) = verbatim in a box.
    - `tex` = pure latex.
    - `inline` = embed result in text.

- `\inln{Arg1}{Arg2}[Arg3]` is designed for simple calculations; it runs one
  command (or a short batch) and displays the output within the text.
  
  - `Arg1` is the executable program or programming language.
  - `Arg2` is the source code.
  - `Arg3` is the output type.
    - `inline` (or skipped or with empty value) = embed result in text.
    - `vbox` = verbatim in a box.

### Language specific shortcuts:

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) 

- `\runJulia[Arg1]{Arg2}{Arg3}[Arg4]` runs an external
  [Julia](https://julialang.org/) code file.
  - `Arg1` is optional and uses
    [talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/)'s
    [Julia](https://julialang.org/) server by default.
  - `Arg2`, `Arg3`, and `Arg4` have the same effects as those of the basic
    command `\runExtCode`.

    command `\runExtCode`.
- `\inlnMatLab[Arg1]{Arg2}[Arg3]` runs
  [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) source code (`Arg2`)
  and displays the output in line.
  - `Arg1` is optional and uses the
    [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) server by default.
  - `Arg2` is the [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
    source code to run. If the
    [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) source code is
    wrapped between "```" on both sides (as in the markdown grammar), then it
    will be implemented directly; otherwise the code will be written to a file
    on the disk and then be called.
  - `Arg3` has the same effect as that of the basic command `\inln`.

[R](https://www.r-project.org/)

- `\runR[Arg1]{Arg2}{Arg3}[Arg4]` runs an external
  [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code file.
  - `Arg1` is optional and uses
    [talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/)'s
    [R](https://www.r-project.org/) server by default.
  - `Arg2`, `Arg3`, and `Arg4` have the same effects as those of the basic
    command `\runExtCode`.
- `\inlnR[Arg1]{Arg2}[Arg3]` runs [R](https://www.r-project.org/) source code
  (`Arg2`) and displays the output in line.
  - `Arg1` is optional and uses the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) server by
    default.
  - `Arg2` is the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) source code to run. If the
    [R](https://www.r-project.org/) source code is wrapped between "```" on both
    sides (as in the markdown grammar), then it will be implemented directly;
    otherwise the code will be written to a file on the disk and then be called.
  - `Arg3` has the same effect as that of the basic command `\inln`.


[Python](https://www.python.org/) 

- `\runPython[Arg1]{Arg2}{Arg3}[Arg4]` runs an external
  [Python](https://www.python.org/) code file.
  - `Arg1` is optional and uses
    [talk2stat](https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/)'s
    [Julia](https://julialang.org/) server by default.
  - `Arg2`, `Arg3`, and `Arg4` have the same effects as those of the basic
    command `\runExtCode`.

    default.
  - `Arg2` is the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) source code to run. If the
    [Python](https://www.python.org/) source code is wrapped between "```" on both
    sides (as in the markdown grammar), then it will be implemented directly;
    otherwise the code will be written to a file on the disk and then be called.
  - `Arg3` has the same effect as that of the basic command `\inln`.

- `\runPythonBatch[Arg1][Arg2]` runs an external
  [Python](https://www.python.org/) code file in batch mode (without a server running).
  Python (at least currently), unlike the other languages we use, does not have an option
  to save and restore a session, which means that once a Python session ends, the
  working environement (variable, functions) is deleted. In order to allow a batch-mode
  in Python, we implemented such capability. It requires the 
  [dill](https://pypi.org/project/dill/) module, which has to be installed via
  `pip3 install dill`.
  - `Arg1` is the [Python](https://www.python.org/) source file name,
  - `Arg2` is the output file name.
