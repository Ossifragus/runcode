This folder contains the files which are needed to create the documentation
for the R package, QREM (https://github.com/haimbar/QREM)
To compile from scratch, create a tmp directory and comment out the [cache]
instances in the tex file. Keep in mind that some of the scripts run a
bootstrap procedure which can take a few minutes.

Read the documentation of the other examples in the runcode repos before
running this example.
