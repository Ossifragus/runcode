       <h1>Demonstrating how to use the talk2stat package with NodeJS</h1>
       <P>The <a href="https://pypi.org/project/talk2stat/">talk2stat</a> package allows programs such as
       pdflatex, Node JS, etc. to communicate with statistical software tools (such as R, Julia, Matlab, etc.)<br>
       This is a very simple demonstration which shows that it is easy to create a web-based garphic user interface
       to perform statistical analysis. Here, we created a form which allows a user to try how different classification
       tools perform in terms of predicting a binary outcome. The user can choose one of 7 classifiers, 4 in R and 3
       in Julia, and select the percentage of samples to be used for training. The results are provided in the form
       of a 'confusion matrix'.<BR>
       In this demonstration the web-based GUI is implemented using Node JS, and the back-end statistical engines are R and Julia. However,
       the set-up is up to the user. For example, a user may prefer to use React JS for the front-end, and Matlab
       for the back-end. The structure and functionality of the form is also entirely up to the user, and developing 
       elaborate dashboards is possible.
      <P>The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is available as a comma-delimited text file on the
        UCI Machine Learning Server (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). 
        The dataset contains 699 fine-needle aspirate samples, where 458 (65.5%) are benign and 241 (34.5%) are
        malignant. 
        The dataset contains a total of 11 variables and doesn’t include the variable names in the file. 
        Sixteen samples have missing data and are coded in the text file with a question mark (?).
        The variables are: <!--<span style="color:blue">-->ID, Clump thickness, Uniformity of cell size,
        Uniformity of cell shape, Marginal adhesion, Single epithelial cell size, Bare nuclei, Bland chromatin, 
        Normal nucleoli, Mitoses, Class<!--</span>-->
        Class is the outcome variable (coded as 2=benign, 4=malignant).
        In this example we will try different methods for predicting whether a patient has breast cancer from the characteristics of a 
        fine-needle tissue aspiration (a tissue sample taken with a thin hollow needle from a lump or mass just under the skin).
        </P>
        <P>Choose the type of classifier from the four available options, and the percentage of the data to be used for training.</P>
